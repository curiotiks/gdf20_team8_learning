## Meeting Notes



## Oct. 16th, 2020

### Graphic Design

* Uploading sprites — A lot of cats and chickens. 
* Has been designing random characters and objects. Is still waiting on us to get the character scripts together. 
* Making Trello card for object ideas to create a queue.
* Pets are becoming instructional agents spread throughout the large city.  

### Scripting/Narration

* A.M. has finished scripting the entire first scene! 
* Moving to have two levels
  * First level only provides basic intro
  * Second level has all NPCs/information to evaluate spread across the town. The instructional agents are dispersed around nearby to the NPC. 
  * This gives us just two levels with a full range of content. 
* [Curt] E-mail Allen Tudyk to see if he would give us audio for our game. 

### Unity Dev

* **Figure out technically how we might have the close-up dialog screens. If they aren't too complicated, then send to Emma to start making larger characters**
* [Curt] Create next town
  * Much larger than starting town 
  * Only a few buildings are enterable
* Completed animations and working with animating chickens! 

### Hard Next Steps — This week

* Curt needs to get in the google drive and contribute and make next town map (get started)
* Dev is getting conversation scripts rolling
* Introduction cutscene
  * Again, asking about whether dialog is in scene or close-up with larger sprites
