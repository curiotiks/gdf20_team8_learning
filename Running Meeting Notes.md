## Meeting Notes

## Nov. 6th, 2020

We're getting close. Need to pare down to bare minimum. Now we'll reduce to introductory scene, then just go to Covidia and the mayor presents the two choices. A fallacy and a logical solution. The player then chooses. 

### Unity Dev

* Quest path for scene and back. Needs object "solve" the quest. 
* Started the scene transition

### Next Steps

* Lee is working on quest transfer (scene transition)
* Matt is dropping NPCs in with conversation scripts
* Curt is going to figure out override controllers. 
  * 



## Oct. 30th, 2020

### Updates

* Emma uploaded sick villagers and puking villager and grandma character
* Lee uploaded the particle effect assignment
* Curt has been writing script

## Oct. 23rd, 2020 - Just next steps

### Particle Effects

* Lee has already made one
* Adding particles coming out of MC's mouth when she speaks
* Make a little test-tube with smoke/bubbles coming out of the top 
  * Can Emma make a small test-tube 

### Graphic Design

* Emma not present

### Scripting/Narration

* Alessandra has added fallacies into the script with examples 
* Completing dialogues

### Unity Dev

* Fixed the broken door issue. Script didn't carry over because it wasn't a prefab. Must make changes to prefabs. 
* Curt see if possible to save building layouts to palette
* Lee is going to start working on getting some dialogue going. 
  * Decisions
* Alessandra is adding sound to chicken
* Include a barrier at the transition point at the edge of town
  * Also has a NPC there that ask, "Are you sure you've spoken to everyone. I know X, Y, and Z wanted to see you before you left." 
  * Player can say yes anyways and move on (autonomy) or say no and go back to talk to the rest of the people. 

### Assignment 11 

* Magic chickens are an important instructional agent, so the particle effects draw attention to the chickens. 
*

### Graphic Design

* Uploading sprites — A lot of cats and chickens. 
* Has been designing random characters and objects. Is still waiting on us to get the character scripts together. 
* Making Trello card for object ideas to create a queue.
* Pets are becoming instructional agents spread throughout the large city.  

### Scripting/Narration

* A.M. has finished scripting the entire first scene! 
* Moving to have two levels
  * First level only provides basic intro
  * Second level has all NPCs/information to evaluate spread across the town. The instructional agents are dispersed around nearby to the NPC. 
  * This gives us just two levels with a full range of content. 
* [Curt] E-mail Allen Tudyk to see if he would give us audio for our game. 

### Unity Dev

* **Figure out technically how we might have the close-up dialog screens. If they aren't too complicated, then send to Emma to start making larger characters**
* [Curt] Create next town
  * Much larger than starting town 
  * Only a few buildings are enterable
* Completed animations and working with animating chickens! 

### Hard Next Steps — This week

* Curt needs to get in the google drive and contribute and make next town map (get started)
* Dev is getting conversation scripts rolling
* Introduction cutscene
  * Again, asking about whether dialog is in scene or close-up with larger sprites
